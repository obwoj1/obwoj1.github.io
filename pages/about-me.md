  bio: |
    I’m currently a junior studying Computer Science at Morgan State  University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2027.

    My work focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and real-world impact—how machine learning, data science, and cloud computing can be used to address healthcare disparities and improve system efficiency

    From analyzing patient data to building cloud-integrated troubleshooting tools, I aim to create smart, scalable solutions that empower communities and enhance user experiences.
