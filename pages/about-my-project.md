problem: >
  People with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) face a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes.
  Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to complications.
  However, managing diabetes involves a lot of decisions, like adjusting insulin doses and tracking blood sugar.
  This can be tricky because every person’s body is different, and their health changes over time.

approach: >
  The project follows a six-phase pipeline:
  1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather and clean health data (e.g., glucose levels, insulin, activity), handle missing values, and engineer useful features.
  2. Environment Simulation: Build a virtual setup that mimics patient responses, defining patient states, actions (like insulin adjustments), and health-related rewards.
  3. DQN Model Development: Use Deep Q-Networks with tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train an AI that learns the best treatment strategies over time.
  4. Training & Evaluation: Train the model on both real and simulated data, update it with new information, and evaluate its performance using health outcome metrics.
  5. Interpretation & Personalization: Make sure AI decisions make medical sense and personalize recommendations for each patient’s unique condition.
  6. Visualization, Reporting, & Presentation: Create visuals and reports to explain the AI’s impact, and present findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.

outcome:
  - "✅ A trained AI model (DQN) that makes personalized treatment recommendations for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients to reduce cardiovascular risk."
  - "📊 A cleaned and preprocessed healthcare dataset, ready for training and analysis."
  - "🧪 A simulated environment that allows testing of various treatment strategies and evaluates their impact on patient health."
  - "📈 Performance evaluation results, showing how well the model improves decision-making and lowers the risk of heart disease or stroke."
  - "👩‍⚕️ Personalized treatment plans, adapting over time to patients' changing health data."
  - "📉 Reduced cardiovascular risk indicators through AI-optimized diabetes management."
  - "📚 Comprehensive documentation and final report, detailing model development, findings, and real-world applications."
  - "🗣️ A final presentation suitable for both technical (AI/CS) and non-technical (healthcare/biology) audiences."
