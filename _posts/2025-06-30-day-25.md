what_i_learned: |
  Now that my Double DQN model is running well with good accuracy, I started tailoring it to directly address my core research question: evaluating how well the model performs — in terms of accuracy, calibration, and fairness — when applied to unseen or underrepresented patient subgroups, such as racial minorities or those with rare comorbidities. This meant adjusting how I analyze results and how I structure subgroup comparisons within the simulation.



blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It felt rewarding to shift from just getting the model to work to making sure it actually answers a meaningful question. Connecting the technical side to real-world equity and health challenges added a new level of purpose to the project. I’m starting to see how AI can be made not just accurate, but fair — and that’s something worth building toward.
