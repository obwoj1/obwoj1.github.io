what_i_learned: |
  Today was a mix of fun, collaboration, and technical learning. We started off by connecting with the full SAiRI 25 cohort and sharing project updates. It was cool to hear where everyone stands. After that, we played Taboo and Jenga, and my team won, so we earned a bonus hour off (huge W). We also had a useful session on using LaTeX in Overleaf, which will come in handy for writing clean, professional documents. Back in the lab, I reviewed some simulation code that models glucose levels using Gymnasium and explored how different parameters affect the simulation. We wrapped up by continuing progress on our design doc.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a great reminder that bonding and breaks are just as important as coding and research. Connecting with the whole cohort helped me see the bigger picture of what we’re building. Winning the game added some good energy to the day, and the LaTeX session gave me tools I’ll definitely use. Diving into the glucose simulation is still a work in progress, but I’m getting more comfortable with the framework. Looking forward to building momentum from today’s balance of productivity and fun.
