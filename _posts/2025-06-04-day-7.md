what_i_learned: |
  Today, my team and I focused on finalizing the comorbidity we want to explore in our research project. Although we initially considered obesity, we noticed the dataset had limited patient data for it, so we decided to shift our focus to hypertension. We spent time researching what hypertension is and how it can be studied within our Type 1 Diabetes project. As a team, we also came up with and answered key questions about hypertension to deepen our understanding and make sure everyone was on the same page. After that, we began working with the dataset that includes relevant features tied to hypertension.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a real turning point. While switching from obesity to hypertension wasn’t what we first planned, it made sense based on the data we had. I liked how collaborative it felt—asking and answering questions as a team helped us learn from each other and stay aligned. It reminded me how flexible research needs to be when working with real-world data. I’m now more confident in our direction and excited to explore how hypertension connects to T1D. Things are starting to come together in a solid way.
