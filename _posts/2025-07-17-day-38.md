what_i_learned: |
  Today I kept working on my DDQN project, continuing to track accuracy and reward fluctuations to spot areas that need tuning. I also had a check-in meeting with my faculty mentor where we discussed ways to improve the model’s stability and fairness across patient subgroups. We reviewed what’s working and brainstormed adjustments to help boost generalization.

blockers: |
  No blockers today — just steady progress and technical refinement.

reflection: |
  Talking through the project with my mentor helped clarify where to focus next. It’s motivating to know that each round of analysis is moving the model closer to something that could have clinical impact. I’m locked in now on refining both performance and equity as the project matures.
