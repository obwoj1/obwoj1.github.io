what_i_learned: |
  Today was a continuation of my work with Double DQN, but this time with new motivation. One of my teammates was able to reach 100% accuracy with their DDQN setup, so I studied their implementation closely and began adapting those ideas into my own code. I’m working to identify what made their model so effective and adjusting my parameters and reward logic to close that gap.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Seeing someone else on the team hit 100% accuracy was inspiring — and honestly, a little humbling. But it gave me a concrete benchmark to aim for and pushed me to dig deeper into how DDQN can be fine-tuned. I’m learning that accuracy isn’t just about writing code — it’s about understanding the logic behind every part of the model. I’m making progress and getting closer, one step at a time.
