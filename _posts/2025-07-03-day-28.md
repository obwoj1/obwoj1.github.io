what_i_learned: |
  Today was presentation day! I shared the progress I’ve made on my Double DQN model, how it’s being used to optimize treatment for T1D and hypertension, and the fairness challenges we're trying to address. It was a great opportunity to explain my work to a wider audience and hear feedback from mentors and peers.

  No blockers — just nerves!

reflection: |
  Presenting at the symposium helped me realize how much I’ve grown over the last few weeks — not just technically, but also in communicating my work clearly. Hearing positive reactions and thoughtful questions reminded me that what I’m building has real impact. It’s motivating me even more for the second half of this project.
