what_i_learned: |
  Today I built and ran a full Double DQN (DDQN) experiment for glucose control using PyTorch. I created a simplified environment to simulate how different insulin and carb intake actions affect glucose levels over time. I implemented a full training loop, replay buffer, reward strategy, and tested the model on a new simulation to evaluate performance. Accuracy was measured by how often the agent kept glucose levels in the ideal range.

  No blockers — just a long and detailed implementation session.

reflection: |
  Running this full simulation from scratch gave me a deeper understanding of how reinforcement learning applies in a clinical context. Watching the agent learn to keep glucose in a safe range felt like real progress. It also helped prepare me for integrating patient data and expanding this into a more complex hybrid model next week.
