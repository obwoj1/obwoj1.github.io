what_i_learned: |
  Today I continued evaluating my DDQN model trained on real patient data. The results across different episodes highlighted key patterns in model behavior and pointed to areas where tuning might boost consistency. I also began looking into the architecture and logic behind Rainbow DQN, aiming to support one of my teammates who's working on implementing it for their own experiment.

blockers: |
  No blockers today — mostly exploratory and prep work for collaboration.

reflection: |
  Revisiting my results helped solidify where my model excels and where it still struggles. It also felt good to shift gears a bit and prepare to help out with Rainbow DQN — I’m excited to learn more about its enhancements and how it compares to what I’ve been building. It’s a nice balance between refining my work and contributing to the team.
