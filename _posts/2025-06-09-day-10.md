what_i_learned: |
  Today, I did a deep dive into a research paper that explored using deep learning models on raw EHR data to predict medical outcomes. The models used structured data and clinical notes to predict things like mortality, readmission, and discharge diagnoses with high accuracy. Techniques like LSTM and attention-based neural networks helped the model outperform traditional methods. Even without manual feature engineering, the AI was able to find patterns directly from the data. It showed how powerful and scalable deep learning can be across hospitals, even with huge datasets.

reflection: |
  This paper helped me see how AI can actually improve healthcare, especially in complex cases like comorbidities. It was cool to learn that predictions could be made earlier and more accurately than usual methods. I started thinking about how this kind of approach could work for people managing both T1D and hypertension. It also reminded me how much potential there is when you combine data science with clinical knowledge. I’m more motivated now to understand how these models work and how we can use them for real health challenges.
