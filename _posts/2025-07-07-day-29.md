what_i_learned: |
  After a long weekend following the Mid-Summer Symposium, today was about regrouping with my team and laying out our plan for the second half of the program. We reviewed our progress so far and discussed what’s left to complete — from refining our models to preparing final deliverables. It was helpful to realign and make sure we’re all on the same page moving forward.

blockers: |
  No blockers today — just a productive planning session.

reflection: |
  Taking time to pause and plan gave us all a clearer picture of what’s ahead. We’ve come a long way, but there’s still more to build, test, and present. I’m feeling recharged after the break and ready to hit the second half of the program with fresh energy and focus.
