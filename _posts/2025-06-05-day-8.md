what_i_learned: |
  Today started with a campus tour beginning at the business school and stretching all the way to CBEIS and back, a long and tiring walk, but a good way to explore the university. After lunch, my team and I met with our graduate mentors and got back to work on our research project. We finalized hypertension as our main comorbidity focus and started asking and answering specific research questions related to it. Using the datasets and some light coding, we tested our ideas and began forming a clearer picture of how to approach our analysis. It was a productive day, even if it was physically exhausting.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was definitely a mix of mental and physical effort. The long walk around campus wore me out, but it was nice to see more of the school. Once we settled back into research, I felt like we made solid progress. Locking in hypertension as our focus helped us narrow down our goals, and working with the data gave us useful insight. I liked how collaborative it felt we kept asking questions and figuring things out together. Even though I’m tired, I feel more grounded in where our project is going.
