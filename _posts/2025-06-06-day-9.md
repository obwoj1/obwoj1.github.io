what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on creating visualizations in my hypertension Colab notebook using Seaborn. I made a bar chart, histogram, and histplot to get a clearer view of patterns in the data. My teammate created a correlation matrix, which helped us explore how different biochemical parameters relate to each other. These visual tools made it easier to spot trends we might have missed just looking at raw numbers. It was also a great way to practice presenting data clearly.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  This was a productive and creative end to the week. I enjoyed building visuals and seeing how graphs can bring the data to life. Working with my teammates on our weekly video was a fun change of pace — we got to highlight everything we accomplished and reflect on the challenges we faced. Recording the video felt like a good way to close the chapter on our first week. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made and excited to dive into our next steps starting Monday.
