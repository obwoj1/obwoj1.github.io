what_i_learned: |
  Today I completed a full 2000-episode DDQN training run using real patient data with 7 input features. I integrated fairness considerations and ran the model across a cohort of over 700 patient profiles. I tracked reward, accuracy (time spent in safe glucose range), and loss across episodes. While some episodes showed strong performance (up to 98% accuracy), there was still wide variance, revealing areas where model tuning and patient-specific adaptations are needed.

blockers: |
  Some warnings related to tensor creation and date formatting slowed things down but didn’t block training.

reflection: |
  Running this at scale gave me a much better sense of how well the model generalizes across diverse patients. Seeing the fluctuation in accuracy and reward helped me realize just how crucial fine-tuning and fairness metrics are. I’m getting closer to real-world simulation, and it feels like a major step forward.
