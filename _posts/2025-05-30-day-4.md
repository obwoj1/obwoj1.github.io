what_i_learned: |
  Today, I brushed up on my skills in file input/output in Python. I practiced writing data to files, reading from them, and copying content, solidifying my understanding of how file handling works.
Later in the day, I dove into the world of generative AI. I learned about large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and how these technologies are used to generate human-like content. It was a really informative session.
We also played some fun and competitive Kahoot games to test our knowledge. To wrap up the day, I collaborated with my group and other participants to analyze different projects and determine whether they were AI-generated or created by humans. It was a great mix of learning, interaction, and critical thinking!

reflection: |
  Today  was a great mix of technical learning and creative thinking. Revisiting file handling in Python helped reinforce the basics, and exploring generative AI opened my eyes to how powerful and versatile these models are. I especially enjoyed the group activity where we had to guess if projects were AI-generated; it really made me think critically about what AI is capable of. Overall, it was a fun and insightful day!
