what_i_learned: |
  Today, I brushed up on my skills in file input/output using Python. I practiced writing to files, reading from them, and copying content, which helped solidify my understanding of file handling.
  
  Later in the day, I explored the world of generative AI. I learned about large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and how these technologies are used to create human-like content. It was a really informative session.
  
  We also played some fun and competitive Kahoot games to test our knowledge. To wrap up the day, I worked with my group and other participants to analyze different projects and determine whether they were AI-generated or created by humans. It was a great mix of learning, interaction, and critical thinking!

reflection: |
  Today was a great mix of technical learning and creative thinking. Revisiting file handling in Python helped reinforce my foundational skills, while exploring generative AI opened my eyes to just how powerful and versatile these models can be. I especially enjoyed the group activity where we had to guess whether projects were AI-generated—it really made me think critically about what AI can do. Overall, it was a fun and insightful day!
