what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first in-person meeting for the CEAMLS '25 cohort. We kicked things off by learning more about the program's structure and goals, followed by group photos and a fun team-building game that helped us get to know our group members better. After lunch, we gathered in the lab where our faculty mentor provided a more detailed overview of our group project. We explored the datasets we’ll be working with and began discussing key questions related to our project’s focus. Toward the end, we reviewed an example code snippet tied to the project and studied its usage notes to understand how exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be applied

  No blockers.

  It felt great to finally meet everyone in person and start building those connections within the CEAMLS cohort. The team-building game made things fun and helped break the ice. Getting a clearer picture of our project and hearing directly from our mentor helped things click a bit more. While the code and datasets seemed a little overwhelming at first, I’m excited to dive in and learn more about how we’ll be using EDA. I’m looking forward to growing through this experience, both technically and as a team collaborator.
