what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent time diving deeper into research on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and its associated comorbidities, particularly focusing on hypertension and obesity. I began reviewing and cleaning some of the available data, noticing that there was more data available for obesity than for hypertension. As a team, we’re still in the process of deciding which comorbidity to focus on for our project, and we plan to finalize this decision in discussion with our faculty mentor. I also started identifying and highlighting the most relevant research questions that align closely with our project’s goals.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a thoughtful step forward in shaping the direction of our research. While we haven't finalized our comorbidity yet, digging into the data and noticing trends, especially with the obesity dataset, gave me more clarity. It’s a bit challenging to balance between what's interesting and what's practical based on data availability, but I’m learning how important that balance is. Highlighting key research questions also helped me focus on what truly matters in our analysis. I’m excited to meet with our mentor soon and narrow our path forward.
