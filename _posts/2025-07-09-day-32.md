what_i_learned: |
  Today marked a significant pivot in our project's trajectory. Following an insightful discussion with our faculty mentor, we've decided to adopt a dual-pronged approach for the next half of the project. This means we're now investigating two distinct, yet complementary, model architectures in parallel. One path will delve deeper into our current lean towards a Double Dueling DQN model, focusing on optimizing its core reinforcement learning capabilities. The second, exciting new avenue involves exploring a Transformer-based RL approach. This will allow us to compare and contrast their strengths, potentially leading to a more robust and generalizable solution. We're also actively testing various configurations and hyperparameters within each approach to identify the most promising avenues.

  No hard blockers, but the challenge now shifts to efficiently managing two separate research tracks simultaneously. This requires careful resource allocation and a structured approach to experimentation and data analysis for each model type.

reflection: |   The decision to pursue a dual approach feels invigorating. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of AI research, where flexibility and the willingness to explore new paradigms are crucial. While it adds complexity, the potential for breakthrough insights by comparing these two powerful model types is immense. I'm particularly keen to see how the Transformer's ability to handle sequential data and long-range dependencies might complement or even surpass the traditional RL strengths of Double Dueling DQN in our specific problem domain. This expanded scope is a clear step towards building a more impactful and publishable result.
