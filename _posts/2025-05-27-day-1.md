what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about Git and GitHub, met my new teammates who I’ll be working with on the project, and we played a fun game to get to know each other and figure out our strengths and how we could contribute. I also took a placement test and participated in a group activity with the rest of the CEAMLS program participants.

  Today was a productive and engaging day as I deepened my understanding of Git and GitHub, which are essential tools for collaboration. I met my new teammates, and we spent time getting to know each other through a fun game that helped us identify our strengths and how we can contribute to the project. We also participated in a placement test and wrapped up the day with a fun group activity alongside other CEAMLS participants. Overall, it was a great start that built both skills and team connection.
