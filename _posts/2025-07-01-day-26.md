what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on refining my DQN model to better align with my research question, especially around predictive accuracy and fairness in underrepresented subgroups. I made some changes to how I structure patient profiles and started thinking about how to evaluate performance across demographic slices. Later, my research group and I worked together on our mid-summer symposium presentation pulling together everything we’ve done so far and figuring out how to communicate it clearly.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Tailoring the model to match the core goals of the project made me realize how important it is to connect technical work with real-world impact. It’s not just about getting the model to run it’s about answering meaningful questions. Collaborating with my group on the presentation also gave me a chance to step back and see how far we’ve come.
