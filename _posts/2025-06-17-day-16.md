what_i_learned: |
  Today, I gained a deeper understanding of how to structure a research question that tackles fairness, performance, and model generalization in healthcare AI. I explored how stratified data augmentation and SHAP values can be used to answer these questions. I also learned the importance of testing RL models early using validation setups tailored to high-risk patient groups like those with hypertension and diabetes.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was a productive and focused day. My faculty mentor guided us through refining our design docs, and I made solid progress on my research question and initial validation plan. Getting constructive feedback helped highlight weak spots and sharpen the direction of my approach. Tomorrow, I’ll continue incorporating those insights to make the doc more polished and practical.
