what_i_learned: |
  Today, we dove headfirst into reinforcement learning, especially Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). I did a lot of reading on how Q-networks work in theory, but applying that knowledge through coding, especially with Noisy DQN ,was a whole new challenge. Even though it was tough, I started to grasp how noise can be used for better exploration in RL, and how this method might help improve decision-making in our comorbidity model.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was one of the more intense days so far. There was a lot of new information to process, and I struggled a bit with connecting all the dots while reading and coding at the same time. Still, I left the day with a stronger, more holistic view of how Noisy DQN fits into our project goals. With more practice and review, I know it’ll click even more.
