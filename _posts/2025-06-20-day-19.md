what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on developing a Double DQN model as part of our reinforcement learning pipeline. I started by reviewing a 40-minute tutorial to reinforce key concepts and understand how DDQN improves over basic DQN. After gathering insights from GitHub repositories and citing useful sources, I used that structure to build out my own implementation. I also integrated real dataset values into the environment, allowing the model to learn from actual patient data. It's now producing decent accuracy, and I’m working on fine-tuning it.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was one of those days where things finally started clicking. It took time to understand the inner workings of DDQN, but once I got the foundation, I was able to translate that into working code. Using real data with the model made everything feel more impactful. While optimizing is still ongoing, I feel proud of the progress and more confident tackling more advanced reinforcement learning tasks moving forward.
