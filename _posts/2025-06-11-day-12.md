what_i_learned: |
  Today, we got hands-on with reinforcement learning through a glucose simulation notebook shared by our faculty mentor. He walked us through the code structure and gave an overview of how it connects to real-time decision-making in healthcare. I explored the code on my own for a bit, testing how different pieces worked and trying to understand the logic. We also discussed how this simulation could apply to our project, especially for managing T1D with hypertension. It helped tie together some of the theory we’ve been learning this week.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Working through real code today made reinforcement learning feel less abstract. I still have more to learn, but seeing how glucose levels could be modeled and optimized made the use case much clearer. The team-building exercise gave us a good break and helped us reconnect before diving back into the simulation. I’m starting to see how this could fit into our final project idea. Excited to keep building on what we’ve started.
