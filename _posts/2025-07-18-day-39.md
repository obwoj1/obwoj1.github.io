what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on preparing for the next phase of experiments. I finalized the list of baseline DQN variants I need to test and began outlining how I’ll compare their performance. I also mapped out the structure for my DQN+Transformer hybrid and reviewed key Transformer encoder patterns for handling sequential data. Lastly, I started drafting setups for the ablation and reward sensitivity experiments.

blockers: |
  No major blockers, just balancing setup time across all the experiments and making sure the architecture is correctly aligned before implementation.

reflection: |
  It’s starting to feel like the work is entering a deeper phase. I’ve moved from just getting models to run, to now thinking about design decisions and how each tweak affects clinical fairness and performance. Laying the groundwork now will save a lot of time and confusion down the line.
