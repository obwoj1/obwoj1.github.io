what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about final prep for our mid-summer symposium presentation. I spent time reviewing my slides, refining the script, and making sure the technical details of my Double DQN model and results were clear and easy to explain. I also coordinated with my team to align our sections and ensure everything flows smoothly.
