what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about improving my Double DQN model with the help of my faculty mentor. He gave helpful guidance on how to better evaluate the model’s performance, especially in terms of realistic glucose control. We reviewed different glucose range standards like 70–180 mg/dL (general), 70–80 (ADA/Mayo Clinic), and 80–130 before meals, which gave me better context for defining the accuracy and reward functions in the simulation.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Having my mentor around really helped clear up some of the confusion I had around optimization. Getting real-world glucose ranges made it easier to think about performance in a clinical context rather than just as numbers in code. There’s still more tuning to do, but now I have a clearer target to aim for and a better idea of how to shape the agent’s rewards to get there.
