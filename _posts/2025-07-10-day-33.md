what_i_learned: |
  Today marked a significant pivot in our research direction as we continued refining our final approach to the project. I also attended a session on scientific writing, where I learned how to communicate complex ideas clearly, structure research papers effectively, and use concise language in technical documentation.

blockers: |
  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Learning about scientific writing came at the right time as we prepare to document everything we’ve been building. I’m more aware now of how important it is to explain not just what the model does, but why it matters. With our pivot underway, I’m committed to finishing the project strong and ensuring our final paper communicates our work clearly and impactfully.
