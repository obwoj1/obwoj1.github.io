what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about troubleshooting and refining my Double DQN model. I focused on getting the code to run properly after facing multiple issues earlier in the week. Once I got it working, I introduced an accuracy measure based on how often the model keeps glucose levels within the safe range. It gave me a clearer picture of performance and showed me that there's still a lot of room for improvement.

  ðŸ’­ Reflection:
Even though today didnâ€™t bring the perfect results I hoped for, just getting the model to run and test my accuracy setup felt like a win. Debugging and realizing how far off the performance was helped me understand what still needs fixing. Reinforcement learning is complex, and the progress isnâ€™t always clean, but Iâ€™m slowly learning what adjustments might get the model closer to something useful.
