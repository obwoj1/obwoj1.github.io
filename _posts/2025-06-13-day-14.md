what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about bridging the gap between theory and application. I explored a glucose simulation notebook using Gymnasium, which gave me a feel for how blood sugar levels can be modeled over time. I also started modifying our reinforcement learning (RL) environment, moving away from random values and beginning to integrate actual biochemical data. This step is helping me better understand how to simulate real patient conditions using our dataset. I also learned how we can evaluate these simulations by designing a meaningful reward function, and it’s exciting to think about how this will make our model more realistic and useful in predicting outcomes.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  This week pushed me to think critically about how our code can reflect real-world data. While it was challenging to understand the inner workings of the RL structure and how to cleanly bring in real patient metrics, I made steady progress. I’m starting to appreciate how machine learning in healthcare isn’t just about writing code — it’s about careful design, thoughtful simulation, and connecting every line of code to actual patient scenarios. As we move forward, I’m excited to keep blending data science and healthcare in a way that could lead to something meaningful.
