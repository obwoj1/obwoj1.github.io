what_i_learned: |
  Today our faculty mentor met with us to reaffirm the direction of our project and make sure we’re aligned on our goals. One major insight was that if we’re serious about pushing this toward a publishable paper, we’ll need a larger cohort 70 patients just isn’t enough. We also started discussing the hybrid model we want to build and explored the idea of using a transformer. Right now, we’re leaning toward a Double Dueling DQN model as the core.

blockers: |
  No blockers — just recognizing the need to expand our dataset and clearly define our model structure.

reflection: |
  It was helpful to get that clarity and encouragement from our mentor. Scaling the dataset and choosing the right model architecture are big steps, but they’re necessary if we want this to have real impact. I’m excited about the possibility of building something stronger and more generalizable with the Double Dueling approach.
