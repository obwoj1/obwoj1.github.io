what_i_learned: |
  Today, I explored two research papers to better understand how they connect to our project. I focused on the abstracts and summaries to grasp the main ideas and how they could inform our work. Our graduate mentor then introduced us to reinforcement learning, encouraging us to build a basic understanding of it. We watched a video that broke it down at a high level, even though it’s a complex topic, I’m beginning to see how it fits into real-world healthcare problems. We also began reviewing a design document that outlines the direction of our project, and we got a walkthrough from our mentor on a call.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It felt good to dig into research papers today and connect theory to what we’re doing. Reinforcement learning is still a little fuzzy to me, but I liked how the video helped simplify the concept — each day it gets a bit clearer. I also appreciated the call with our mentor; seeing a real design doc made everything feel more structured and real. It’s exciting to know what’s coming next and have a clear path forward. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into the doc and bringing our ideas to life.
