what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on computer vision and how machines interpret visual data. We learned about real-world applications like facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. After that, we set up YOLOv8, a real-time object detection model. The setup had a few bumps, but we were able to run basic detections successfully. We also participated in a fun, fast-paced team activity that challenged our communication and problem-solving skills. To wrap things up, we reviewed Python file I/O, which will be important for handling data in our upcoming work.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was one of the more hands-on and engaging days. Setting up YOLOv8 was a little frustrating at first, but it felt good once we saw it working. The escape-room game really brought out our teamwork and helped us bond more as a group. It reminded me that soft skills matter just as much as technical ones. Reviewing Python file operations gave me a confidence boost since I’ve used that before. Overall, today pushed me technically and helped me grow as a collaborator.
