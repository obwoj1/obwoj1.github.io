what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about Git and GitHub, met with my new teammates whom I would be working with on the project, and got to know each other. We played a little game to figure out our strengths and how we could contribute to the project. I also took a placement test and joined a fun group activity with the rest of the CEAMLS participants afterwards.

  Today was a productive and engaging day as I deepened my understanding of Git and GitHub, which are essential tools for collaboration. I met my new teammates, and we spent time getting to know each other through a fun game that helped us identify our strengths and how we can contribute to the project. We also participated in a placement test and wrapped up the day with a fun group activity alongside other CEAMLS participants. Overall, it was a great start that built both skills and team connection.
