what_i_learned: |
 Today was a really informative and engaging day! I explored OpenCV and YOLO, two powerful tools used in computer vision. Specifically, I worked with YOLOv8 for object classification, which allowed me to detect and identify objects in images with high accuracy.
Later in the day, I participated in a fun and collaborative activity with my teammates, an escape room challenge. We split into groups and had to solve puzzles to help each other escape. It was a great team-building experience that encouraged communication, strategy, and quick thinking
To wrap up the day, there was a helpful review session on what I learned yesterday. We revisited concepts like dictionaries and sets in Python, and I also learned how to read from and write to files in Python

Today, I learned about OpenCV and YOLOv8, and used it for object classification in Python. I also participated in a fun escape room activity with my teammates, where we solved puzzles together. Later, we reviewed Python concepts like dictionaries, sets, and file I/O, which helped reinforce what I learned yesterday. Overall, it was a great mix of technical learning and team collaboration.
