what_i_learned: |
  Today was a mix of fun, collaboration, and technical progress. We kicked off the day with the SAIRI Connect session at the Earl Graves Business School, where we played a few team-building games. One challenge involved describing our project without using any key terms, which really made me think about how to communicate complex ideas simply. After meeting the high school teachers joining our lab, I headed back and focused on Deep Q-Networks. I shared some of my insights with my team and then shifted my attention toward understanding and experimenting with Double DQN (DDQN).

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was a refreshing day that mixed creative thinking, teamwork, and deep technical focus. Playing the games was a great break that also helped me practice explaining my project more clearly. Back in the lab, digging deeper into DDQN challenged me, but I’m beginning to understand its improvements over standard DQN. It's a lot to take in, but step-by-step, I'm getting more confident.
